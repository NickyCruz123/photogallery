							<h2>Squirrel</h2>
							<p>
								There were a lot of squirrels out when I was out taking these pictures.
								They are one of my favorite animals so I'm happy I was able to get a decent picture of one without it running away.

							<h2>Floating Leaf</h2>
							<p>When I was walking near the Duck Pond looking for subjects to photograph I saw a lot of leaves floating in the water.
								I also saw a small puddle with some dry leaves near it.
								I wanted a picture of one leaf delicately floating in water, so I gently placed a dry leaf on the puddle.

							<h2>Bench</h2>
							<p>I love finding things made by humans slowly being taken over by nature.
								Part of it makes me at peace and connected with nature, while the other part of me is reminded of what it may be like in the future when humans are no longer here.
								This bench with mosses and fungi growing on it with a few fallen leaves on it gives me those feelings and thoughts.

							<h2>Pond Leaves</h2>
							<p>I took this picture leaning over a small but sharp drop off at the Duck Pond.
								I was almost afraid that I would drop my cameria in or fall in myself.
								However, I think the leaves floating in the water along with the beams of sunlight coming throught the tree above made the risk worth it.</p>

							<h2>Crisp</h2>
							<p>Nothing says fall more than the ground being covered with so many leaves that you can barely see the grass underneath.
							It makes me think of when I was a kid and my dad would gather them into a pile that I could jump and play in.</p>

							<a href="images/fulls/06.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/thumbs/06.jpg" alt="Duck Pond Gazebo" /></a>
							<h2>Duck Pond Gazebo</h2>
							<p>This is one of my favorite places to sit down and have a break at when I take a walk.
								It is beautiful itself and has a lovely view of the pond, and is very peaceful because very few people past by.
								It's also a gym in Pokemon Go that I can take over when I'm sitting down there, which makes any place better.

							<h2>Stump</h2>
							<p>I pass this tree stump often and everytime I do I think of how it would be a good picture.
									While I have taken pictures of it with my phone before, I was glad I could get a picture with a good camera.</p>

							<h2>Coffee Break</h2>
							<p>One of my favorite fall activities is going to Starbucks with my friends.
									Even though I am one of the few people who dosen't like pumpkin spice, I enjoy most of their other fall seasonal drinks, such as the salted caramel mocha. </p>

							<h2>Time for Change</h2>
							<p>These pictures were taken when only a few trees were changing color for fall.
							This picture is of a bush that always turns a beautiful bright red in the early fall.
						I pass by it very often so I'm able to see more and more leaves change color as time goes on.</p>

									<h2>About</h2>
									<p>
I'm Nicky, a 2nd year student at Virginia Tech.
I'm getting a dual degree in Fashion Merchandising and Design and Multimedia Journalism with a minor in Popular Culture.
This cite is my final project in the Web Presence unit for my Visual Media class.
Here you can view pictures I took for the Photographic Composition unit of the class.
For this unit I took pictures that captured the theme of "Fall in Blacksburg".
I hope you enjoy the site and the pictures!
